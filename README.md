PacMan exercise

Description: This is an exercise that was done by Owais Uddin Ahmed for week 4 of the MIT xPro Full Stack Development in MERN course. It was completed on 31/03/2022. It is an exercise in learning how to move and change images while detecting the left and right edges of the screen and keeping within them. When run, the output looks like the video game character PacMan moving back and forth between the left and right edges of the screen with its mouth opening and closing.

Usage: copy/download the files in the "pacman" folder and open index.html in a web browser.
